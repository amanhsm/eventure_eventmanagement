-- 1. Ensure admin_feedback column exists and is properly configured
ALTER TABLE events ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS admin_feedback TEXT;

-- 2. Ensure changes_requested status is properly configured
ALTER TABLE events DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS events_status_check;
ALTER TABLE events ADD CONSTRAINT events_status_check 
CHECK (status IN ('draft', 'pending_approval', 'approved', 'rejected', 'cancelled', 'completed', 'changes_requested'));

-- 3. Create events with changes_requested status for ALL organizers for testing

    COUNT(e.id) as total_events
FROM organizers o
LEFT JOIN events e ON o.id = e.organizer_id
GROUP BY o.id, o.name

-- 5. Show all changes_requested events with feedback
SELECT
